           Linear Regression Data Fit Results
   
           Notes:
           1.     The raw data consists of the date data - integer converted to real.
           2.     The Fatality data consists of the daily counts - integer converted to real.
           3.     The fatality data is converted to logarithm base 10 data.
           4.     The assumption is made that a zero fatilty count is set to 0.1, to avoid zero problems with the logarithm analysis.
           5.     The ft routine is the Fortran 77 code from Numerical Recipes in Fortran -- this does not interfere with DISLIN.
           6.     The exponential equation is established using standard transforms for the linear results on the linear - log space.
           7.     The linear equation is y = ax + b - using the standard model.   
           8.     The y data set is log(deaths).
           9.     The exponential equation is z = c*(e**d).    The symbols ** is the power function.
           10.    The transformations are  c = (10 ** b) and d = a/(log(e) :  e is the number 2.718281828459045
           11.    The regression analysis fits the data by minimizing chi squared.
           12.    Two loops are used for the analysis:
                  a.   The first assumes unknown standard deviations
                  b.   The second assumes estiamted standard deviations.
           13.    The information returned as a and b and the uncertainity sigma (a) and signma(b), chi squared and goodness of probablity of q.
           14.    If the SD are unknown the q is returned as 1.0 and the nomralization of chi squared is to unit standard deviaitons.

           Notes:
           1.     The raw data consists of the date data - integer converted to real.
           2.     The Fatality data consists of the daily counts - integer converted to real.
           3.     The fatality data is converted to logarithm base 10 data.
           4.     The assumption is made that a zero fatilty count is set to 0.1, to avoid zero problems with the logarithm analysis.
           5.     The ft routine is the Fortran 77 code from Numerical Recipes in Fortran -- this does not interfere with DISLIN.
           6.     The exponential equation is established using standard transforms for the linear results on the linear - log space.
           7.     The linear equation is y = ax + b - using the standard model.   
           8.     The y data set is log(deaths).
           9.     The exponential equation is z = c*(e**d).    The symbols ** is the power function.
           10.    The transformations are  c = (10 ** b) and d = a/(log(e) :  e is the number 2.718281828459045
           11.    The regression analysis fits the data by minimizing chi squared.
           12.    Two loops are used for the analysis:
                  a.   The first assumes unknown standard deviations
                  b.   The second assumes estiamted standard deviations.
